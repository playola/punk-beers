# Punk beers

Beers list and detailed information. This project was bootstrapped using `create-react-app`. I did not eject to have a clear view on what I added and what the tool generated.

## Core libraries

* React
* Redux Saga
* Styled Components
* Jest
* Prop Types

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

The application is has been tested and styled on the latest version of Chrome.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/playola/punk-beers.git

cd punk-beers

yarn install

yarn start
```
See http://localhost:3000/.

## Running the tests

```
yarn test
```
The tests are not fully completed due to time constraints. For now, the errored tests are skipped.

## Improvements

- Complete the tests.
- Add debounce when we scroll down to fetch more beers.
- Performance of locale storage.
- Add loader when fetching.
- Error management, e.g.: Modal with the HTTP error.
